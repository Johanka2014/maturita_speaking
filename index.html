                             - <strong>England:</strong> St. George's Cross (a red cross on a white background). <br>
                             - <strong>Scotland:</strong> St. Andrew's Cross or the Saltire (a white diagonal cross on a blue background). <br>
                             - <strong>Wales:</strong> Y Ddraig Goch (the Red Dragon - features a red dragon passant on a green and white field). It's important to note the Welsh flag is not represented in the Union Jack, as Wales was legally part of the Kingdom of England when the first version was created. <br>
                             - <strong>Northern Ireland:</strong> Historically represented by St. Patrick's Saltire (a red diagonal cross on a white background), though its official status is complex. Northern Ireland does not currently have its own official unique flag. The St. Patrick's Saltire was incorporated into the Union Jack.<br><br>
                             <strong>The Union Jack (or Union Flag):</strong><br>
                             The UK's national flag is a combination of flags representing different parts of the kingdom:<br>
                             - <strong>1606:</strong> After the Union of the Crowns (James VI of Scotland also became James I of England and Ireland), the flag of England was superimposed onto the flag of Scotland to create the first Union Flag.<br>
                             - <strong>1801:</strong> With the Act of Union that united Great Britain and Ireland, the St. Patrick's Saltire was added to the design, creating the Union Jack we know today.  <br><br>
                             <strong>Discussion:</strong><br>
                             - Why do you think the Welsh flag isn't part of the Union Jack design?<br>
                             - What does the Union Jack symbolise to you?<br>
                             - Are national flags still important symbols in the 21st century?`
